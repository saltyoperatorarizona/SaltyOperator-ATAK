## About This Plugin

AIS-Direct is a free, open source vessel tracking plugin for ATAK. Designed to function like ADSB-Direct (the popular aircraft tracking plugin), AIS-Direct brings real-time Automatic Identification System (AIS) data directly into the ATAK interface — allowing operators to monitor maritime vessel traffic worldwide without ever leaving the app.

Users can connect to live AIS data streams and display vessel positions, headings, speeds, and call signs directly on the ATAK map. Stream data can be filtered by geographic range or reference location, giving operators the ability to focus on vessels within a defined operational area. A dedicated Military quick filter allows users to instantly isolate military vessels from the broader traffic picture.

AIS-Direct supports multiple data source backends including AISStream (WebSocket), MarineTraffic, and direct NMEA/TCP connections, making it compatible with a wide range of AIS receivers and online services.

## How to Access

Once installed, open the ATAK Tools menu and tap **AIS-Direct** to launch the plugin. It sits alongside your other ATAK tools — including OSINT — for quick access during maritime operations.

## AIS-Direct Main Panel

The main panel displays the current connection status and stream configuration. Toggle AIS-Direct ON or OFF directly from the panel header.

Three data source tabs are available at the top:
- **AISStream** — WebSocket-based live global AIS feed (`wss://stream.aisstream.io/v0/stream`)
- **MarineTraffic** — Integration with MarineTraffic API
- **NMEA/TCP** — Direct connection to a local AIS receiver or NMEA TCP feed

## Vessel Filters

The FILTER section provides two options:
- **All Vessels** — Displays every AIS-broadcasting vessel within your configured range and location
- **Military** — Instantly filters the map to show only military vessels, enabling rapid maritime domain awareness in operational environments

The Military quick filter is one of AIS-Direct's standout features, allowing warfighters and maritime operators to declutter the map and focus exclusively on relevant traffic.

## Reference Location & Query Range

AIS-Direct allows users to define exactly where they want to monitor vessel traffic:
- **Reference Location:** Map Center or My Location (device GPS)
- **Query Range (NM):** Set the nautical mile radius for vessel queries (e.g., 120 NM)
- **Update Interval (S):** Configure how frequently the plugin polls for new vessel data

## AISStream Configuration

Tapping the AISStream tab opens the stream configuration dialog:
- **API Key** — Enter your AISStream API key to authenticate with the live feed
- **API URL** — Default: `wss://stream.aisstream.io/v0/stream`
- **Broadcast CoT** — When enabled, vessel positions are broadcast as Cursor on Target (CoT) events to your ATAK team network

Advanced filtering options:
- **MMSI Filter (CSV)** — Track only specific vessels by MMSI number
- **Vessel Type Filter (AIS Codes)** — Filter by AIS vessel type codes
- **Reset Defaults** — Clears all filter settings back to default values

## Live Vessel Tracking on Map

When active, AIS-Direct populates the ATAK map with vessel icons showing real-time position, heading, speed, and call sign. Each vessel displays a data callout including: Call Sign, MMSI / CoT ID, Heading (degrees), Speed, and Accuracy. Vessels are rendered with directional heading indicators, allowing operators to quickly assess vessel movement and intent across large maritime areas.

## Getting API Keys & Data Source Setup

AIS-Direct supports three data source backends. Here is how to get set up with each one.

### 1. AISStream (Recommended — Free)

AISStream is a free, community-supported WebSocket API that streams live global AIS data. It is the recommended data source for most users.

**How to get your free API key:**

1. Go to [aisstream.io](https://aisstream.io) and click **Get started**
2. Click **Sign In With GitHub** — AISStream uses GitHub OAuth exclusively (no separate email/password account required)
3. Once signed in, navigate to the **API Keys** page from your account dashboard
4. Click **Create API Key** and copy the generated key
5. Paste the key into the **API Key** field in AIS-Direct's AISStream tab

**Notes:**
- AISStream is in beta and provided without an SLA or guaranteed uptime
- The WebSocket URL is: `wss://stream.aisstream.io/v0/stream`
- For support, submit an issue at [github.com/aisstream/issues](https://github.com/aisstream/issues)

### 2. MarineTraffic (Paid Subscription)

MarineTraffic is a commercial maritime data platform. API access requires a paid subscription starting at $10/month for basic vessel tracking, with higher tiers for advanced data.

**How to get a MarineTraffic API key:**

1. Create a free account at [marinetraffic.com](https://www.marinetraffic.com)
2. Navigate to **My Account > Online Services** and select a plan (Basic starts at $10/month — a 7-day free trial is available)
3. Once subscribed, go to your account **Developer / API** settings to find or generate your API key
4. Enter the API key into the **API Key** field in AIS-Direct's MarineTraffic tab

**Notes:**
- MarineTraffic is a paid service — a free tier with API access is not available
- MarineTraffic has been acquired by Kpler. Existing MarineTraffic accounts and API keys continue to function at [marinetraffic.com](https://www.marinetraffic.com)
- If you only need vessel tracking without a paid subscription, use AISStream instead

### 3. NMEA/TCP (Local AIS Receiver — Free, Hardware Required)

NMEA/TCP allows you to connect AIS-Direct directly to a physical AIS receiver on your local network. This is ideal for operators who have their own AIS hardware (e.g., a standalone AIS receiver or a vessel's onboard AIS transponder).

**No API key required.** This option uses a direct TCP connection to a local device broadcasting NMEA 0183 AIS sentences.

**How to set it up:**

1. Connect an AIS receiver to your local network (via Ethernet, Wi-Fi bridge, or USB-to-serial adapter with a TCP server)
2. Common AIS receiver options include:
   - **Vesper Marine, Garmin, or Raymarine AIS transponders** with network output
   - **RTL-SDR dongles** running software like AIS-Catcher or ShipPlotter to decode and serve AIS over TCP
   - **ShipXplorer / AirNav AIS receivers** with built-in network sharing
3. Find your receiver's IP address and TCP port number (commonly port **10110** or **2947** for NMEA streams — check your device's manual)
4. In AIS-Direct's NMEA/TCP tab, enter the **IP address** and **port** of your AIS receiver
5. Tap Connect — AIS-Direct will begin receiving live vessel data from your local hardware

**Common NMEA TCP port references:**
| Device / Software | Default Port |
|---|---|
| gpsd (Linux GPS/AIS daemon) | 2947 |
| AIS-Catcher (RTL-SDR) | 10110 |
| Vesper / Garmin AIS transponders | 10110 |
| ShipPlotter | 10110 |
