## About This Plugin

Optimal Zero is a free ATAK-CIV plugin that implements a G1 ballistics engine to calculate the optimal zero distance for Maximum Point Blank Range (MPBR). Enter your optic type, caliber, load, barrel length, optic mount, and vital zone â the plugin returns your optimal zero distance, MPBR distance, a drop table at standard intervals, and a full rendered trajectory chart.

Built for ATAK 5.6, targeting operators who need fast, accurate ballistic solutions directly in their tactical interface without leaving the map environment.

## How to Access

Tap the **Optimal Zero** icon in the ATAK Tools menu to open the plugin side panel. The OPTIMAL ZERO header and MPBR BALLISTIC CALCULATOR subtitle appear at the top of the panel.

---

## Features

- **Optic type selection** â Red Dot MPBR fully implemented; BDC Reticle, MOA Reticle, and Mil Reticle modes are Phase 2
- **Full ammo database** â caliber-specific G1 BC and per-load MV curves by barrel length
- **Barrel length 4"â24"** â covers PDW, pistol, PCC, carbine, and precision rifle with automatic MV calculation per caliber and load
- **MV override field** â enter chronograph-verified velocity to bypass the auto-calculated MV
- **Optic mount cowitness** â Absolute / Lower 1/3 / Other with Height Over Bore and Riser Height inputs
- **Vital zone input** â define the MPBR hit envelope in inches
- **CALCULATE MPBR button** â gold, the only color in an otherwise black/gray tactical UI
- **Solution output** â optimal zero (yd and m), MPBR distance (yd and m), near zero distance
- **Drop table** â in-zone indicators (â/â) at standard distances from 25 to 500yd
- **Trajectory chart** â full rendered arc showing bullet path with zero distance marked
